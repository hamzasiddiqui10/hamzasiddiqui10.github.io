# Sample Project

This folder demonstrates the recommended structure for keeping per-project files in this site.

- `index.html` — A lightweight project landing page (this file).
- `README.md` — This overview.
- `notebooks/` — Put Jupyter notebooks here.
- `data/` — Small example datasets. Avoid committing large raw datasets; use links instead.

Tips:
- Keep project folders self-contained and document how to reproduce results.
- If you need to store larger artifacts, consider Git LFS or external storage and link from the README.
